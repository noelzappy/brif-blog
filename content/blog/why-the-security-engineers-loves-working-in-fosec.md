Working in cybersecurity means you’re constantly playing a game of catch-up. Every day you learn something new, but your work is also never finished.

Whether you are a security researcher developing threat intelligence to power IDS / IPS systems or someone trying to plug holes in an area like application security, you will constantly be forced to find new solutions for unknown problems.

To Dutch security engineer Ferry (he prefers us not to share his last name), it’s this ever-evolving part of infosec that’s kept him in the field for over a decade. He currently works for Rijks ICT Gilde, a group of tech consultants who work on a variety of Dutch government IT projects. 

> “The thing I love most about my job is that every day comes with new challenges and opportunities. There are always new vulnerabilities to expose, new detection systems to set up, new hackers to catch. This job really is never done.”

Security engineers love working in the field of cybersecurity, also known as infosec or fosec, for a variety of reasons. One of the main reasons is the constant challenge and ever-evolving nature of the field. With new technologies and threats emerging all the time, security engineers are always learning and adapting to stay ahead of potential attacks.

Another reason security engineers enjoy working in fosec is the sense of purpose and importance of their work. With the increasing reliance on technology in nearly all aspects of our lives, the need for robust and effective cybersecurity measures is more critical than ever. Security engineers play a critical role in protecting sensitive information and ensuring the continuity of vital systems and services.

Additionally, the field of fosec offers many career opportunities and paths. From incident response and penetration testing to risk management and compliance, there are a wide range of specializations and roles to choose from. This variety allows security engineers to find a career that aligns with their interests and skills.

Finally, many security engineers find the field to be intellectually stimulating and rewarding. The field is full of complex problems and puzzles, and when a solution is found, it can be extremely satisfying.

Overall, security engineers appreciate the dynamic and challenging nature of fosec, the sense of purpose and importance of their work, the variety of career paths available, and the intellectual stimulation and rewards of the field.
